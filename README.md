# NLP-Data-jobs

As students in our final year of master's program, we are preparing to enter the job market. We undertook this project to assess the skills required by companies for a data scientist position. To achieve this, we used a dataset of job postings available on Kaggle, containing salaries and job descriptions for data scientists in the United States. Although this project is not exhaustive, we used common models such as K-means, XGBoost, and natural language processing concepts to conduct our analysis. You should find the notebook to be well-documented and accessible. We hope you find it informative and enjoyable to read.
